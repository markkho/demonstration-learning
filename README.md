# Teaching with and Learning from Demonstration

Code for models of teaching with and learning from demonstration,
including showing as planning in an observer belief MDP.

You can start by looking at the visualizations of the model in the 
[Visualizations notebook](Visualizations.ipynb). 

The simulation data was generated in the 
[Model_Simulations notebook](Model_Simulations.ipynb).

Data from experiment 2 in [Ho et al. (2016)](https://markkho.github.io/documents/NIPS_2016_Teaching_by_demonstration.pdf) is available in `\data` and plots are in `\plots`.
