# Teaching with and Learning from Demonstration

Code for models of teaching with and learning from demonstration,
including showing as planning in an observer belief MDP discussed in Ho et al. (2018)[^1]

## Models

You can start by looking at the visualizations of the model in the 
[Visualizations notebook](Visualizations.ipynb). 

The simulation data was generated in the 
[Model_Simulations notebook](Model_Simulations.ipynb).

## Data
Demonstration data from experiment 2 in Ho et al. (2016)[^2] is available in `\data\teaching-trials.pd.pkl` and plots are in `\plots`. The plots were generated in the [Experiment-Data notebook](Experiment-Data.ipynb)

Judgment data reported in Ho et al. (2018) is in `\data\learning-responses.pd.pkl`.
